# API BOOKS PHP TRAINING

##  - Project Description

This is a project to practice the basic CRUD operations on an API. This application manages books with their data. Every CRUD operation is done from the frontend with JavaScript to the API with PHP.
This operations are : 
- create a book
- read a book
- update a book
- delete a book

## - Technologies used : 

- PHP for the backend because I am practicing PHP at this moment, I wanted to practice the CRUD operations on a API
- MySQL for the database, there is only one table (books)
- Vanilla JavaScript for the frontend, I wanted to practice sending data to the API with <code>fetch() </code>
- Bootstrap for the style. I used Bootstrap because the aim of this project was to practice the CRUD between JavaScript and the API, so I did not want to spend time with the CSS.
- I also used Postman to test the HTTP requests to the API.

## - To do later :

Next, I will practice testing the API with PHPUnit.
